# Concept Drift Datasets v1.0
## Background
Concept drift describes unforeseeable changes in the underlying distribution of streaming data over time[1]. Concept drift problem exists in many real-world situations, such as sensor drift and the change of operating mode. Detecting concept drift timely and accurately is of great significance for judging system state and providing decision suggestions. In order to better test and evaluate the performance of concept drift detection algorithm, we have made some datasets with known drift types and drift time points, hoping to help the development of concept drift detection.
## Usage
If you want to use the datasets in the project, you can download them directly and import them using the pandas library.
